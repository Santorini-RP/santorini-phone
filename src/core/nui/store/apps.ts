// DEPRECATED: This store is no longer used for app configuration.
// App configurations are now loaded and managed by the AppManager service.
// See: /src/core/nui/services/appManager.ts

// This file is kept to avoid breaking imports in a single step,
// but it should be removed in a future cleanup.
